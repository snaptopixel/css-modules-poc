# CSS Modules Proof-of-Concept
A minimal setup for playing with Webpack's “CSS Modules”
> NOTE: There is no front-end framework in place (React, Angular, etc) just doing some basic dom creation to keep things simple, and focused on the task at hand.
 
### Developing
- Run `npm start`
- Open <http://localhost:9090>
